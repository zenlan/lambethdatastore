Over £500 expenditure open data
===============================

From January 2011, we are publishing monthly reports describing the majority of our spending decisions over £500 for payments made in the previous month, and the sum of those payments for each supplier.

To protect vulnerable residents, we have decided not to include payments to people who receive direct payments for social care, or payments to people who provide care. 

We are voluntarily disclosing this information in the interests of openness and accountability. If you would like more information, you can submit a Freedom of Information request to [mailto:foi@lambeth.gov.uk](foi@lambeth.gov.uk).
